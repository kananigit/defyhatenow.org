In the case of South Sudan, social media has emerged as a new source of ethno-political conflict. According to the United Nations and international experts, South Sudan is at the brink of genocide and has been plagued with famine throughout the region this year. Ethnic conflict has erupted since December 2013 amongst parties that are aligned with President Salva Kiir of the Dinka tribe, against those aligned with Former Vice President Riek Machar, of the Nuer tribe. Although South Sudan is among the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/development\/desa\/policy\/cdp\/ldc\/ldc_list.pdf\">world\u2019s least developed countries<\/a> and about 70% of its population is illiterate, hate speech and fake news disseminates through the internet and spreads violence to regions that don\u2019t even have electricity. Local and international organizations have responded to the gravity of situation through their work. One result of this collective effort is the <a href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/hate-speech-in-south-sudan1\">Lexicon of Hate Speech Terms<\/a> which is the first of its kind to identify the vocabulary used to incite violence of social media.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>#defyhatenow #anataban #peace4all #SouthSudan #PeaceTechLab<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hate Speech in South Sudan: Social Media as a Weapon of War PeaceTech Lab, 03 May 2017 In 2016 PeaceTech Lab conducted research to better understand the connection between online [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"video","meta":[],"categories":[6,8,166,13,164,14],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.2.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Countering Social Media as a Weapon in South Sudan - #defyhatenow<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Countering Social Media as a Weapon in South Sudan - #defyhatenow\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Hate Speech in South Sudan: Social Media as a Weapon of War PeaceTech Lab, 03 May 2017 In 2016 PeaceTech Lab conducted research to better understand the connection between online [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"#defyhatenow\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2017-05-03T15:53:01+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-09-02T09:48:59+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DHN-Logo.png\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"604\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"496\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"admin\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Defyhatenow\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/favicon.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Defyhatenow\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/\",\"name\":\"#defyhatenow\",\"description\":\"\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/\",\"name\":\"Countering Social Media as a Weapon in South Sudan - #defyhatenow\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2017-05-03T15:53:01+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-02T09:48:59+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#\/schema\/person\/0a59c2de0098afc3e73140b96f4d0457\"},\"headline\":\"Countering Social Media as a Weapon in South Sudan\",\"datePublished\":\"2017-05-03T15:53:01+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-02T09:48:59+00:00\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/peacetechlab_video\/#webpage\"},\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/#organization\"},\"articleSection\":\"Film,News,Open Tech &amp;
