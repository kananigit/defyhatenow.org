On Saturday, January 18<sup>th<\/sup>, South Sudan\u2019s national basketball team battled the Kenyan Morans in the FIBA Afro basketball pre-qualifiers game. Although the South Sudan basketball team narrowly lost to their Kenyan counterparts, the sentiment of unity is what has stayed with South Sudanese as opposed to the brunt of the loss. Regardless of people\u2019s differences in beliefs and positions on the political side of things, South Sudanese managed to come together and support the team in a show of solidarity and unity that is possible for South Sudan. The impact that the basketball team had in uniting South Sudanese was also expressed in some of the tweets that have followed the match as it can be seen below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1064\" height=\"1291\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313.jpg 1064w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313-744x903.jpg 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313-768x932.jpg 768w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313-580x704.jpg 580w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/20200120_104313-860x1043.jpg 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/NzhNVkUrrgN_I0S4iHHuxAC7ipfY2u_HxG7BrtTkm3ahbbaUh0QFAQnwhREnkcwcrPSWQJsKErUQvnDr8mwkuZeZNXw3luUPmz-5pl0TqgHwEL7YxMh3WrSDiSFrp7qYxW5pvg_Y\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/NU89_R6G_YxWf5bBzmK9VtuKU3w6aRnZ4BNoiTLIwjzczShcczswT0OzIZ-xzy3w1Yv5Lg452El5gipbpuZK5k9fWbyJcMWKygEeNtM_x1JfruTcHBCj2iMHezkXcffS5UhApCW3\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the social media posts that continue to trickle in from across social media platforms have been positive, show support and the desire for continued integration and peacebuilding in South Sudan.
