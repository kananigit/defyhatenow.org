Our work focuses on creating a framework for increasing trust between stakeholders through mobilizing civic action against all forms of hate speech and incitement to violence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#defyhatenow<\/strong> seeks to support the voices acting against online induced conflict to go \u2018viral\u2019 within and outside affected regions by bringing youth, community leaders, grassroot organizations and further civil society stakeholders into a peace oriented media and information literacy framework. Bridging gaps of knowledge and awareness of social media mechanisms between those with access to technology and those without, <strong>#defyhatenow<\/strong> is a growing network of online and offline peacebuilders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In partnership with <strong>r0g_agency for open culture &amp; critical transformation gGmbH <\/strong>and<strong> UNESCO &#8211; Central Africa Directorate, <\/strong>the newly formed <strong>#defyhatenow<\/strong> CBO based in Juba, South Sudan has been working in an effort to have a conversation on the dangers of hate speech online and offline, it\u2019s effects and how to mitigate it. Earlier in 2019 we held a <strong>Workshop on Prevention of Violent Extremism Online and Offline<\/strong> hosted by UNESCO in Douala, Cameroon. The workshop took place within the context of a conflict induced breakdown in communal cohesion in many regions of Cameroon that has taken place at a time of increasing socialization embedded in information and communication. The security context and the atmosphere of the 2018 presidential elections on the one hand, and the parliamentary, municipal and regional elections, on the other hand, have been marked by an increasing expansion of ethnic polarization, hate speech, radicalization and extremism occurring both offline and online. Online hate speech, propaganda, incitement to violence, and threats are posted and shared by key players (influencers) amongst social media groups and on timelines. The tone of rhetoric, reflected in both traditional broadcast and print media, and more recently \u2013 with increasing aggressivity &#8211; across social media platforms has exacerbated peacebuilding and attempts at inter-communal harmony. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a grant provided by the German Federal Foreign Office, this peacebuilding collaboration is being enabled to keep the conversations going, develop resources and support local activist peace oriented media-based activities. We\u2019re currently looking to fill the role of <strong>Project Associate to be based in Yaounde and\/or Douala&nbsp; Cameroon <\/strong>where we are starting an exciting project on Mobilizing Civic Action to Counter Violent Extremism Online and Offline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Requisite skills<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To succeed in this role, you should:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have e<strong>xcellent time management and communication skills,<\/strong> as you\u2019ll collaborate with clients and internal teams to deliver results on deadlines.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You will also need to be <strong>self driven and diligent <\/strong>in your roles<\/li><li>Be <strong>fluent in both English and French <\/strong>(written and spoken)<\/li><li>Have at least <strong>3 years<\/strong> working experience in a <strong>context related <\/strong>to the job<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the <strong>Project Associate<\/strong> you will work closely with our team \u201cremotely and on the ground\u201d to prepare comprehensive action plans, on implementation of the project.
