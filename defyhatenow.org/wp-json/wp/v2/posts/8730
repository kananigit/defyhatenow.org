The captions alleged that a twenty-year-old South Sudanese lady, identified as Atong James, has been arrested by the National Security, on the accusation of supporting the newly formed Red Card Movement (RCM) and died as a result of torture in Juba, South Sudan.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news was posted by RCM TV Facebook page, Juba TV Facebook page, South Sudan TMZ Facebook page, and shared by some South Sudanese influencers including two prominent politicians; Suzanne Jambo, and Nyarji Roman,&nbsp; and a&nbsp; few other individuals.&nbsp; However, a few days after the circulation of the Facebook post, Juba TV shared a video countering their previous claim by stating that Evelyn Athieng (the lady in the photo) was indeed alive and was not arrested, as was suggested. Hence, Juba TV offered an apology to its followers for sharing the misinformation\/inaccurate.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on our research into the story, #Defyhatenow organization is pointing out that, while it is true that some security actors in South Sudan have a habit and history of arresting activists and dispersing protesters in the past, this photo has no connection to such incidents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photo that has been circulating on Facebook and Twitter is of a South Sudanese refugee, Evelyn Athieng,  who is residing in Kakuma camp. The photo of her in handcuffs was taken when she was arrested a few years ago for traveling to Nakuru without proper travel documents. The name Ms. Atong James, that had been used by RCM and many individuals belongs to Athieng\u2019s mother, who is not an activist and is not affiliated with any political movement.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pivotal question that remains unanswered is; why did so &#8220;media houses&#8221; and individuals share this news before verifying it?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From our findings, the campaign to associate the photo with the name \u201cAtong James \u201d has been well-coordinated, deliberate, and planned.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is what we have found from data on Facebook posts <br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1-Post claiming \u201cAtong James \u201d was arrested.   <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.55.27.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8733\" width=\"373\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.55.27.png 760w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.55.27-744x899.png 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.55.27-580x701.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2- Post alleging the death of \u201cAtong James\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.56.10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8732\" width=\"402\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.56.10.png 746w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.56.10-744x710.png 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.56.10-580x554.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><figcaption><br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3-A post countering the&nbsp; claim and stating  the lady in the picture is not Atong James and she is alive&nbsp; \u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8734\" width=\"429\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design.png 940w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design-744x624.png 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design-768x644.png 768w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design-580x486.png 580w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Untitled-design-860x721.png 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4-Apology and retraction of a post by Juba TV<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.57.16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8731\" width=\"412\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.57.16.png 740w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-15.57.16-580x644.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" \/><figcaption><br><br><br> <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation\/554645\"><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/public.flourish.studio\/resources\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>What has been the reaction on Social Media&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation\/557637\"><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/public.flourish.studio\/resources\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation\/557842\"><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/public.flourish.studio\/resources\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>#defyhatenow reached out to Red Card Movement, who initiated the rumor,&nbsp; via Facebook for more information on this.

In fact, as we share this post, there is an activist who was jailed and many are still campaigning for his release.&nbsp;Making an unsubstantiated story about the death of an activist is both insensitive and reckless because it undermines the stories of people whose lives are in danger, people who continue to face threats due to their activism. In addition, the fact that a picture used in the story is of an innocent girl is something that we strongly condemn.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We urge all actors to work on ensuring that their public platforms are used to create trust and share accurate and truthful information.
