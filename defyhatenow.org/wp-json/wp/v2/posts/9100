The program is&nbsp; focused on how to cultivate the skills needed for creating a healthier and safer online experience devoid of toxic  ideologies, hate speech, misinformation, disinformation and fake news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our fellows, <strong>#ConnectingTheDots<\/strong> hopes to create conditions that make it difficult for hate speech and fake news&nbsp; to proliferate by helping users and organization develop the resilience and knowledge needed to tackle such vices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first cohort is a diverse team of professionals with communications, broadcast journalism, community development and education backgrounds. They each bring unique and broad perspectives on&nbsp; #DefyHateNow\u2019s efforts towards creating safe and cohesive online spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next three months, each fellow will work on a unique idea that they will implement within the framework of #defyhatenow programs and projects in any of the five countries we currently operate in. Unlike our previous internship programs, the fellowship allows fellows to have a broader scope of work and more autonomy and recourse to enable them to perform their tasks in the most optimal environment possible. <br> Each fellow will be embedded in a department and assigned a supervisor who will provide guidance and program mentorship during the three months. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first cohort of fellows will tackle topical issues in some of the thematic areas listed below: <br> -Digital Rights and Civic Space <br> -Media Development <br> -Hate speech mitigation<br> -Fact-checking <br> -Research <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet Our Fellows!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9094\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-744x496.jpg 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-580x387.jpg 580w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-860x573.jpg 860w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/judyannet-1160x773.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judyannet Muchiri<\/strong> is a community development advocate, researcher, writer, and editor.
