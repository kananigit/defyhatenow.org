As far as the Anglophone Crisis is concerned, there has been a bitter exchange of social media platforms between pro and Anti separatists factions. Pro United Cameroon groups like MKPD have been doing all to counter-narratives of Separatists groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MKPD\nFacebook released pictures of alleged traffickers of ammunitions and guns\ncaught in Idenau near Limbe meanwhile, another popular group on Facebook, BAS,\nBrigarde Anti Sardinad, used same pictures insinuating torture of innocent\ncivilians by the Military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another\ntrending issue that took the social media by storm this week is the happenings\nin some colleges and high schools in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many stories were being recounted, the minister of Secondary Education made a balance intervention blaming both students and teachers and condemning such acts, however, agents of disinformation and hate were quick to pick up a part of it and shared on social media, saying the Minister took sides with the student who killed the teacher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this week, these elements will constitute the base of fact-checking a case of disinformation and a case of Fake News.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fake News<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9372\" width=\"300\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2.jpg 875w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2-744x966.jpg 744w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2-768x997.jpg 768w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2-580x753.jpg 580w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163658_Word-2-860x1117.jpg 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We\nopen this report with a post by a post which was shared to BASS Brigade Anti\nSardinad by a Facebook user.

To add fuel to the fire, the author says being silent about such\nhappenings is being part of the situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, another post that was made the same day by another Facebook page, MKPD shared the same images, this time adding pictures of bullets and other dangerous items found with those arrested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to MKPD, the images were those of traffickers of bullets from neighbouring Nigeria intercepted by the Gendarmerie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163709_Word-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9373\" width=\"258\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163709_Word-1.jpg 696w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163709_Word-1-580x1000.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163721_Word-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9374\" width=\"217\" height=\"477\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the presence of these two different stories with a similar picture, it was worth the salt to dig into the matter to see which version was fake and which was real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our\nsource is The Limbe Gendarmerie Brigade where our findings confirmed that\nactually the picture was that of traffickers and not innocent civilians being\ntortured as BAS, Brigade Anti Sardirnad Facebook post shared by the Facebook\nuser indicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nChef De Poste at the Limbe Gendarmerie Brigade whose name we got as Abomo\nconfirmed that they were traffickers and of bullets and other food items from\nNigeria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\nwere informed at the level of Company Commander\u2019s Office that those arrested\nalongside with what was taken from them have been transferred to Buea under\ncustody and investigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence,\nthe post by BAS Anti Sardinard was fake news, with the intention of hurting\nAnglophones and continues its Anti Biya Agenda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/977627259109171\/posts\/1212347538970474\/?app=fbl\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/977627259109171\/posts\/1212347538970474\/?app=fbl<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-facebook wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"><\/div><script async=\"1\" defer=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v5.0\"><\/script><div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/105487064173863\/posts\/177562676966301\/?app=fbl\" data-width=\"750\"><blockquote cite=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MKPD.Cameroon\/posts\/177562676966301\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><p>SWEET NEWS.

The recent case of the stabbing of a School Teacher in Nkolbison, Yaounde was received with shock by all and sundry. This pushed the Minister of Secondary Education, Dr Nalova Lyonga to make a stopover at the school for situational analysis. After making her remarks, a post on a popular Social Media Forum, Cameroon Vision, insinuated that the Minister has taken sides with the Student who stabbed the Teacher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163732_Word-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9375\" width=\"289\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163732_Word-1.jpg 684w, https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163732_Word-1-580x1089.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Screenshot_20200128-163750_Word-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9376\" width=\"244\" height=\"514\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Post read, \u201cThe Minister of Secondary Education Dr Nalova Lyongahas blamed a Mathematics Teacher for not reporting a delinquency case to the administration but chose to fight back at a Form 3 student.\u201d Reactions which followed were abusive to the Minister as well as to Francophones as one commentator puts it that \u201c\u2026..These dangerous and disgraceful manners are coming from East Cameroun\u201d, hence Francophones are more prone to such violence and actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our source for the fact-checking of the information above is the actual and full interview of the Minister of Secondary Education, here attached. In the over 4 Minutes Interview, the Minister did not take side with the student not the administrative and teaching staff of the school. Rather she blamed both sides in the matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An\nexcerpt of the Minister\u2019s Interview begins by stating that investigations have\nbeen opened and went further to law the first blame on the parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\nhave a problem everywhere\u2026. This student came to school with a knife; the knife\nwas not in school. He certainly came with the knife from home. When school\ndisciplines students, the parents come and scold the teachers.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On\nthe part of the teachers, she said \u201c \u2026 the teachers have to make a distinction\nbetween a case which is a disciplinary case and one which is a criminal case\nand be able to report to the special police placed at the schools so they can\ndo their work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conclusion is that the author of the post on Cameron Vision Whatsapp Forum decided to highlight an aspect in the Minister\u2019s interview that favours his agenda and intentionally leaving the other parts where the Minister was cautioning parents and students. This to this fellow is an element of Disinformation with a purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations\/\nObservations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\ncontinue to observe that Facebook Pages which were created purposefully to\nshare their Hate Agenda are still doing so unchecked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A\npage such as MKPD has an Anti Ambazonian Agenda and it is doing all to\nfrustrate the actions of Separatists. This is done through propaganda, which of\ncourse happens on both sides; hence we must be vigilant when we see information\nfrom such sites or pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nsame applies to a page like, We Love Ambazonia which is also a propaganda page\nused by separatist fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the timetable for campaigns draws near, we remain watchful in pages, forums groups that have political and ethnic characteristics from creating, there will definitely be some serious hate, disinformation and fake news there. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summary This week has been characterized by a good number of Fake News, Disinformation, Hate Speech as well as attacks on persons with a lot of following.
