I came back to South Sudan in 2008. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started my studies in Khartoum, where I did both my primary and secondary school certificate at &nbsp;Combonian Catholic Schools. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What inspired you to become a journalist?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have witnessed a lot of gender-based violence. I have heard of massive rape done by uniformed men where women\/girls are randomly raped by two or three men at a go. Underage girls between the ages of 11-15 are gang raped like they are toys to play with. They lose their innocence and are scarred for life because of such experiences. Being a woman in South Sudan I knew I had a voice and an opportunity and I knew I wanted to tell these stories, so that maybe someone can help. It was my way of helping my fellow women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-936\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/MG_1093-744x49611.jpg\" alt=\"_MG_1093\" width=\"744\" height=\"496\"><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also happen to speak both English and Arabic which helps in communication and reporting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Tell me a gender-based violence experience you have witnessed.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time, early in the morning at around 6:30 AM I heard a woman screaming, \u201cHE WILL KILL ME, HE WILL KILL ME\u201d I dressed in a hurry and I rushed outside. I found a husband beating his wife with a black leather belt, at first I thought it was the guy who sells water as the whips sound similar when applied to a donkey. Looking closer I saw a woman wailing and a man hurling insults at her while beating her, as the men surrounding them watched laughing and encouraging the husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our neighbor grabbed the leather belt and shouted at him to stop it. That\u2019s when everyone left in a hurry. As a woman there was nothing I could do to stop him. I stood there and painfully watched because if I dared to interfere I would be harassed endlessly but it was painful to stand by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Has someone been violent towards you directly?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not physically, just verbally and mostly from men. I think for just being a woman with a job and also being a journalist is enough to warrant some form of violence here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Most of your work is based on human rights and transparency issues and South Sudan, why is that?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a woman and most of the cases concerning human rights violations involve women being abused in one way or another. Not many people want to talk about these issues but they need to be told openly to the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underage girls and women who are gang raped need someone to tell their stories to, even if it\u2019s anonymously. I had a case where a girl had been brought to the hospital by the Bishop. She had been gang-raped; her clothes were soiled and bloody. Her body was swollen; she was crying and was inconsolable. I was so angry and bitter with the world. If I was alone I might have punched the air to release the tension but I remained calm because I had to do the story and give that girl strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What challenges do you face because of your work?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be scary especially in South Sudan but I like my work so I always ensure I get my information from trusted sources to avoid complications. It\u2019s also hard to gather sensitive information, especially when it is fresh so I give it time to cool down then I start digging for information afresh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-934 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/18557364_1477823188942918_3727906602802144917_n11.jpg\" alt=\"Maura Ajak\" width=\"638\" height=\"960\"><\/p>\n<p><b>You have been recognized and awarded for your reporting on transparency and gender issues in South Sudan; &nbsp;how did that feel and what does this award mean to you?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really felt honored, it is a lift up stage for me to do more as a human rights defender. The award has given me the courage to bring up the unheard voices In terms of issues that considered a taboo in some communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What are your hopes for journalism in South Sudan? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope we have an institution where journalists can gather and get updates on the happenings routinely. I also hope we have a space where human rights issues and sensitive issues e.g conflicts and gender-based violence can reported with the openness they deserve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How do you think &nbsp;South Sudanese nationals can use social media to defy hate and preach peace<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should feel free to share our experiences in a way that impacts the world positively. Childhood stories, old stories from our ancestors and day to day stories showing the progress and steps we have made as a country. These stories would help to achieve peace by creating awareness about the consequences of war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you tell anyone reading this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one thrives in war. Most people love peace and peace begins with you and me. Let\u2019s not incite each other and especially with this era of social media let\u2019s thrive to preach peace. #defyhatenow<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 200;\">This interview was conducted &amp; written by <a href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/www.gasabe.co3.ke\">Kendi Gikunda<\/a> &nbsp;.
