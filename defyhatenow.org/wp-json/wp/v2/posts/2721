Here the need for peaceful coexistence with each other is emphasized, they are guided through various programs to help develop leadership capacity and manage the effects of trauma. YSAT was formed as a voice to address these needs, as some of the youth have experienced a high level of trauma, they have scarce resources and often their leadership capabilities are underrated by stakeholders, among other challenges. YSAT bridges the gap between NGOs and refugee youth in their communities and aims to create a diverse youth network that connects them with decision makers to rebuild youth capacities in leadership and create more cohesive communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#defyhatenow has collaborated with YSAT since the beginning of 2017 in trainings, Community Dialogues, Meetups with various Stakeholders and Youth groups, Organizing Peace Jams, Peace Concert and activities that are aimed to bring peace in the 33 villages of Rhino Camp with extension to Koboko, and possibly Bidibidi and Imvepi Refugee Settlements this Year.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2724\" style=\"width: 754px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2724\"
