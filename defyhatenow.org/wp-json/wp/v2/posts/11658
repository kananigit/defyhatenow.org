One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.vn\/IioqF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">purports<\/a> to impart \u201cserious excellent advice\u201d from \u201cJapanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That \u201cadvice\u201d asserts regular sips of water can prevent the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, from entering the respiratory system:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Water Will Not Prevent the Coronavirus from Entering Your Lungs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It is true that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system by directly entering the body through the mouth or nose. This fact is central to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/about\/prevention.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CDC<\/a>) and World Health Organization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/advice-for-public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WHO<\/a>) recommendations to wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The assertion in this viral \u201cadvice,\u201d however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during <\/em><em>any<\/em><em> infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/afs:Content:8551030197\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Associated Press<\/a>, \u201cWe always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.\u201d He also said: \u201cIt makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>BuzzFeed News: Fake images purporting to be medical advice from UNICEF are circulating on social media and group chats.

This is, of course, wholly untrue,&#8221; the spokesperson, Joe English, said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To members of the public, we ask that you seek accurate information about how to keep yourself and your family safe from verified sources, such as UNICEF or WHO, government health officials, and trusted healthcare professionals; and that you refrain from sharing information from untrustworthy or unverified sources.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exerpts from BuzzFeed news: Misinformation, hoaxes, and snake oil cures have all been rampant online since the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Ways to avoid misinformation during the CoronaVirus pandemic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Politifact Epidemic Misinformation Handbook<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/article\/2020\/mar\/12\/7-ways-avoid-misinformation-during-coronavirus-pan\/\">https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/article\/2020\/mar\/12\/7-ways-avoid-misinformation-during-coronavirus-pan\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Learn the basics of the disease<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the symptoms? How does it spread? What diseases is it similar to?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Ignore posts that say the disease is planned<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early stages, it can be difficult to tell where an epidemic started, especially if it&#8217;s a new disease. That\u2019s where conspiracy theories come in. Resist the urge to share these baseless claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Verify images and videos: <\/strong>Ongoing epidemics are ripe for out-of-context or misleading visuals. Be skeptical of images or videos that claim to show people affected by the disease or the government\u2019s response to it. When in doubt, use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/websearch\/answer\/1325808?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Reverse Image Search<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/reveye-reverse-image-sear\/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RevEye<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invid-project.eu\/tools-and-services\/invid-verification-plugin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">InVid<\/a> to find the original context of images or videos you see on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Double-check case numbers, death tolls and fatality rates<\/strong>: These are the numbers that officials use to measure the severity of epidemics &#8211; and they change day to day. For a verified count of those affected by the disease, look to WHO\u2019s situation reports, JHU CoronaVirus Map or CDC reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Beware of attempts to downplay or inflate the threat of the disease: <\/strong>Epidemics often get politicized, and some people will use spin to deflect blame or create a scapegoat. Epidemics can have any number of causes, and assigning blame is never as simple as people want you to believe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Don\u2019t share prevention or treatment methods without consulting official sources<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an epidemic spreads around the world, so too do social media posts prescribing tactics for preventing and treating infection. Some hoaxes like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/factchecks\/2020\/mar\/06\/donald-trump\/trump-wrongly-blames-obama-limits-coronavirus-test\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drinking bleach<\/a> to cure coronavirus may be dangerous, while others may be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/factchecks\/2020\/feb\/29\/facebook-posts\/no-vitamin-c-cannot-slow-or-stop-spread-coronaviru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">harmless<\/a>, but the end result is the same: misinformation. Look for guidance from the CDC, WHO and local public health authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Look for what\u2019s still unknown: <\/strong>It\u2019s an uncomfortable truth, but there is often a lot that scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/03\/07\/upshot\/how-deadly-is-coronavirus-what-we-know.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">don\u2019t know<\/a>. Details like how the disease spreads, at what point it\u2019s contagious and how deadly it is can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/article\/2020\/jan\/31\/readers-guide-misinformation-about-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take weeks or months<\/a> to figure out. In the meantime, bad or made-up information proliferates online. To avoid it, stick to what\u2019s known about the epidemic \u2014and look for trustworthy sources that are upfront about what they don\u2019t know as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.politifact.com\/politifact\/photos\/PolitiFacts_Epidemic_Misinformation_Handbook.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Sub-Saharan Africa needs a unique response to COVID-19<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/authors\/neema-kaseje\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Neema Kaseje<\/a> Founder, Surgical Systems Research Group, 30 Mar 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The African context is unique.
