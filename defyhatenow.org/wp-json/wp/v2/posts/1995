There was a high expectation for growth and many believed they would not see another conflict in the country they fought so hard and so long for. However, war erupted in Juba in mid-December 2013 and quickly transformed into a national, political and ethnic crisis.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2014 the first ceasefire agreement was reached. Fighting continued and would be followed by several more ceasefire agreements. A peace agreement is known as the &#8220;Compromise Peace Agreement&#8221; was signed in August 2015 and later collapsed in 2016 when fighting erupted in Juba, South Sudan. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBetween October and November 2016, there was a sudden and alarming increase of inflammatory language by citizens, expressing hatred &#8211; and at times inciting violence &#8211; against individuals or groups, notably based on their ethnicity or perceived beliefs, acts or political views. This occurred in the context of the non-international armed conflict, exacerbating ethnic divisions and violence on the basis of ethnicity,129 and heightening the risk of mass atrocities. Hate speech was spread through various forms of communication, including private conversations, public speeches, social media exchanges, SMS intimidating messages, images, cartoons published in the press, and threatening letters. The use of degrading terms associating some communities with animals (e.g., parasites, insects, monkeys, baboons) was observed, aimed at dehumanizing groups or individuals.\u201d &#8211; REPORT ON THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION IN SOUTH SUDAN SINCE THE JULY 2016 CRISIS <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About the training<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#defyhatenow is working to mitigate hate speech on social media through three identified aspects; spreading awareness, counter-messaging, and social media literacy.
