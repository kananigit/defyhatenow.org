We have seen firsthand the creativity and the ability to evolve and change, but we have also witnessed our ability to use these technologies for spreading negativity and hate speech. In today\u2019s world, no matter how filtered our timelines are; we can\u2019t escape the armies of online trolling and rumor spreading. The good news is we haven\u2019t given up on ways to combat these armies, that\u2019s why I was so intrigued when I heard about #DefyHateNow; an urgent community peace building initiative aimed at combating online hate speech and mitigating incitement to offline violence in South Sudan. I was even more excited when I heard about the short film \u201cDefy\u201d which they made as part of combating hate speech through art.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday the 17th of March 2018, at the <a href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\">House of Heritage<\/a> \u2013Khartoum, I was in the audience for the first screening of the film in Khartoum.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2135\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/DSC_1117-744x49711.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"497\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The film starts with a breathtaking scene from Juba, showing us the small details of everyday life, with its absurdity and realness, we see a couple fighting in the street and a neighbor being bored by what might seem outrageous to any outsider. After that the story begins and we are introduced to the heroes of the story \u201cSoftware\u201d a young internet entrepreneur and his girlfriend \u201cHadiya\u201d and how they navigate the world of social media and its dangerous intersection with politics.<\/p>\n<p>From the first moments of the film, you can tell that you are in for a treat when it comes to cinematography. The Director Egily Hakim Egily and his team show us a different side of Juba that we rarely see, and the special moments of chaos at the beginning and the end of the film. You can\u2019t help but notice the amazing eye for details and the beautiful acting performances.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2136\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/DSC_1118-744x49711.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"497\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cDefy\u201d does not offer solutions or clean endings, you find yourself asking million of questions once it ends, and it also tells the story in an informative manner that is different from what we are used to in fictional films, nevertheless the film has a strong message and does not shy away from telling it in a very realistic manner.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s even more intriguing about this film is that it opens the door for filmmakers and artists to tackle heavier subjects, and to use their platforms to tell difficult stories without compromising the artistic element. At the end of the \u201cDefy\u201d screening, and unlike other films; there was a general feeling in the room that this is only the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lujain AlSedeg Since the rise of social media and its dominance in our everyday life, we have been exposed to different aspects of the human nature.
