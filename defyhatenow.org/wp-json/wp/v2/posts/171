Two years later, six-year old Deng Thiak Adut was taken away from his family&#8217;s banana farm in South Sudan and conscripted into the Army. After undergoing military training, several years of army service and witnessing numerous atrocities, Deng was still a boy when he was shot in the back while running through a village.<\/p>\n<p>A further two years later, a chance meeting led to Deng reuniting with his brother who helped smuggle him out of the country by hiding him in a corn sack on the back of a truck. The two brothers befriended an Australian family and eventually arrived as refugees in 1998. After working at a local service station to learn English, Deng enrolled at TAFE and completed his Advanced Diploma in Accounting before deciding to study law. In 2005 he enrolled in a <a href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/stories_of_unlimited#stories-9277991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bachelor of Laws at Western Sydney University<\/a> and became the first person in his family to graduate with a law degree.<\/p>\n<p>Deng now works as a lawyer in Blacktown, where he is determined to ensure that other Sudanese refugees have the legal advice and support they need before entering the court system.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1985, the Sudanese government began destroying villages eventually leading to the rise of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army.
