The hours following the announcement witnessed several instances of misinformation, hate speech, and doxxing of individuals. #Defyhatenow and #211CHECK have been monitoring and reporting these incidents on social media. This statement is our informed response to this matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On personal privacy and confidentiality&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We note <\/em>with great concern the consistent and, at times, careless attempts by some social media users to share personal information related to the COVID-19 cases in South Sudan. Following general medical patients\u2019 confidentiality practices and the need to protect personal privacy, especially during such difficult times; These attempts have led many to share baseless information and personal details obtained without the consent of individuals or the organizations involved. We have noted several cases of doxing in the past few days, a practice most Social Media companies have strict rules against. <strong>Doxing<\/strong>, or <strong>doxxing<\/strong> (from &#8220;dox&#8221;, abbreviation of <em>documents<\/em>), is the i<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Internet\">nternet<\/a>-based practice of researching and publicly broadcasting private or identifying information (especially personally-identifying information) about an individual or an organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We advise<\/em> the public to refrain from speculative and conspiratorial sharing of information online and offline. Such practices lead to personal harm and incitement to violence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On hate speech, xenophobia, and anti-UN sentiments.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has also come to our attention the surge in the amount of online hate and a few instances of incitement to violence against the UN and foreigners in South Sudan. Some of these attacks were specifically directed at&nbsp; UNMISS. These accusations are nonfactual; such statements have the potential to incite violence against the UN and its personnel in South Sudan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We urge <\/em>South Sudanese to avoid hate and direct incitement to violence. COVID-19 is a global pandemic, humanity is in this together. Let us follow the government&#8217;s directives on keeping safe and avoid false information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On information and awareness<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid misinformation at this time, we urge citizens to stay informed and follow the guidance provided by the South Sudan Ministry of Health, The World Health Organization, and the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19, as well as the various awareness and information campaigns by the media and civil society.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We encourage <\/em>the authorities to open more information channels to answer questions and receive feedback from the public on matters related to COVID-19 in South Sudan. The absence of open and responsive communication channels often leads to people opting to vent their frustration through other less healthy avenues; in this case, online hate, conspiracy, and misinformation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>About COVID-19&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCOVID-19\u202fis\u202fa disease\u202fcaused by a new strain of coronavirus. \u2018CO\u2019 stands for corona, \u2018VI\u2019 for virus, and \u2018D\u2019 for disease.
