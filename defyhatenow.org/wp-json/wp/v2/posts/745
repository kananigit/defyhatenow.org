These small sign posts will be used to write important peace notes and spread around the school like the ones the team to Bweyale saw on the school compound. This will help remind teachers, students and parents that come to school and the messages of peace will continue to spread around the communities every day.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-756\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Peace-Respect-744x74411.jpg\" alt=\"Peace - Respect\" width=\"744\" height=\"744\"><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>History books. The teacher suggested that if there could be any way #defyhatenow can find encouraging history books on national and community peace building to be given to students to read all the time to give hope and love for their nation they would appreciate that.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-757\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Defyhatenow10-744x66911.jpg\" alt=\"Defyhatenow10\" width=\"744\" height=\"669\"><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Games and sports. This is the most unifying event that brings schools and communities together, because this brings all students from different schools, tribes, cultures, denominations together to competition among themselves know each other and learn from each other hence peace building come automatically among themselves.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-391\" src=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Samir-Basketball_PeaceJam-744x4951.jpg\" alt=\"samir-basketball_peacejam\" width=\"744\" height=\"495\"><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Support orphans at schools. Orphans are the most neglected people when it comes to treatment, care, school, justice, and more. The teachers said if #defyhatenow can help generate support for orphans it could be better for them to learn and participate in peacebuilding through education and not to think or feel bad for being an orphan.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If #defyhatenow can help to do this the education will spread even to the helpless.
