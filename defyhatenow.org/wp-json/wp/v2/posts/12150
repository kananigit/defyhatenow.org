It will focus on how people access public information and how<br> they communicate with each other during conflict and in the absence of conflict. Specifically,<br> the accessibility, affordability, and availability of phone and Internet networks to the people in<br> South Sudan and how these factors vary between 2013 and 2019. The scope of the work<br> focuses on three main regions in South Sudan (Juba, Yei and Malakal) and the Rhino Refugee<br> Camp in Northern Uganda. These areas were selected because they were affected by the<br> conflict at various times during the 6 years. The regions are also very geographically,<br> economically, and ethnically different from each other; this will allow us to measure the impact<br> in various locations and see the similarities and differences in how connectivity changes based<br> on the conflict.<br> Preliminary conversations with experts and a look at literature show that there are five key<br> factors that collectively determine the accessibility, affordability and availability of mobile and<br> Internet networks which in turn shapes the nature of conflict and connectivity in South Sudan.<br> These factors include infrastructure, population density, fluctuating economy, third party<br> interference and social media. To fully understand the nature of conflict and connectivity, it is<br> imperative to look at these factors in a comprehensive way that can inspire practical and<br> effective calls to action. This research project therefore intends to tease out the various<br> connections and relationships among these factors and broadly demonstrate how they<br> collectively shape conflict and connectivity in South Sudan. The main goal in this project is to<br> demonstrate the ways in which conflict relates to connectivity in order to draw attention to the<br> mechanisms of control that are in place to influence people\u2019s access to information during<br> conflict and the absence of conflict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Objectives<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To find out how conflict affects connectivity in South Sudan and conversely howconnectivity shapes conflict<\/li><li> To find out how the Internet has empowered and\/or disempowered political actors in South Sudan<\/li><li> To examine how increased use of digital media has impacted the political landscape inSouth Sudan<\/li><li> To draw attention to the centrality of connectivity in peacebuilding among communities<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summary of Project: This project broadly examines the relationship between conflict and connectivity in South Sudan; the effect of conflict on connectivity and the ways in which phone and Internet [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":12151,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[146,144],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.2.1 -
