During this phase, a fact-checking fellowship was established under the name #FactsMatter237, that phase has produced top-notch fact-checking professionals in the fight against misinformation, disinformation and hate speech online.<\/p>\n<p>After the first cohort, the fellowship was renamed to Africa Facts Checking Fellowship dubbed #AFFCameroon launched in July 2020. Ten fellows who are professional bloggers, journalists and cyber-influencers from the South-West, North-West, Littoral, Center and the west were picked.<\/p>\n<p>To date, there are 18 online fact-checking and hate speech detection professionals trained under the #defyhatenow program with technical assistance from ADISI-Cameroon through its branch www.datacameroun.com. These fellows were trained as part of the quarterly fellowship in advanced fact-checking techniques. They learned from experts from various world-leading players and international organisations.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of Covid19 and in collaboration with The European Union and UNESCO Cameroon we are launching the call 3rd cohort of the program which will run through the months of November 2020 to January 2021. The aim of this program is to create a critical mass of fact-checkers, fake news fighters, hate speech online and offline, and digital rights advocates.<\/p>\n<p>Misinformation and propaganda have existed for as long as humans lived and communicated with each other, provided there is information sharing, its alterations, and manipulation is bound to happen. The advent of social media has made it possible for individuals (users) to share information quickly and at an unprecedented scale. This new era of information sharing and social media creates unique misinformation challenges that have the potential to cause societal divisions and worsen the state of public discourse.<\/p>\n<p>Governments, private sector, media, and civil society actors worldwide are working hard to mitigate the effects of misinformation and the dangers of harmful online content.<\/p>\n<p>The push to tackle &#8220;Fake news&#8221; stems from the global realization of the danger that misinformation and misleading content poses to individuals, institutions, and the public in general. With the UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres remarking that &#8220;Our common enemy is #COVID19, but our enemy is also an &#8220;infodemic&#8221; of misinformation. To overcome the #coronavirus, we need to urgently promote facts &amp; science, hope &amp; solidarity over despair &amp; division&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This sentiment are also shared by many institutions nationally and globally as noted in UNESCO\u2019s J<a href=\"https:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/ark:\/48223\/pf0000265552\">ournalism, \u2018Fake News\u2019 &amp; Disinformation Handbook for Journalism Education and Training,\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now, the danger is the development of an &#8216;arms race&#8217; of national and international disinformation spread through partisan &#8216;news&#8217; organisations and social media channels, polluting the information environment for all sides in a way that can come back to haunt the initiators themselves&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Fact-checking as a practice is not new; it has been an established part of newsrooms for a long time. Fact-checking of online information and public claims has been growing over the past few years; this growth is motivated by the need to mitigate the increase in fake and online misinformation, a subject that is not well covered by the traditional media.<\/p>\n<p>In Africa, organizations like Africa Check and Pesa Check have been working to combat misinformation by providing active fact-checking of online news and rumours.<\/p>\n<p>In Cameroon the fact-checking ecosystem is nascent but growing at a rapid pace, with the most notable platforms being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/datacameroon.com\/\">Data Cameroon<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.stopblablacam.com\/\">STOPBLABLACAM<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/stopintox.cm\/\">Stopintox.cm<\/a>\u00a0, and the most recent one being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.covid19.cm\/\">COVID-19 CM<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who should apply:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Journalists<\/li>\n<li>Content creators and influencers<\/li>\n<li>Digital rights activists<\/li>\n<li>Bloggers<\/li>\n<li>Between 17 and 35 old<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Conditions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Be available from the beginning to the end of the fellowship<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deadline<\/strong><br \/>\nOctober 20, 2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":13338,"template":"","meta":{"_job_location":"Cameroon","_application":"https:\/\/forms.gle\/P2iV9oRhvXFEzQus8","_company_name":"Defyhatenow West & Central Africa","_company_website":"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/defyhatenow_cameroon\/","_company_tagline":"#defyhatenow #hatefreecameroon","_company_twitter":"@DefyhatenowWCA","_company_video":"","_filled":0,"_featured":0},"job-types":[178],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.2.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Africa Fact-checking Fellowship #AFFCameroon, Cohort 3 Application - #defyhatenow<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/defyhatenow.org\/job\/africa-fact-checking-fellowship-affcameroon-cohort-3-application\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Africa Fact-checking Fellowship #AFFCameroon, Cohort 3 Application - #defyhatenow\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"French version\u00a0here Deadline October 20, 2020 The pilot phase of #defyhatenow Cameroon launched in September 2019 and successfully ended in April 2020.
