SUMMARY:#AFFCameroon Cohort 1B Workshop & Monitoring
DESCRIPTION:#AfricaFactcheckingFellowship â€“ #AFFCameroon was designed to follow up & to succeed our #FactsMatter237 Fellowship of January 2020 aimed at monitoring & mapping viral trends on social media related to the key thematic issues in #Cameroon. Fact-checking of online information & public claims has been growing over the past few years; motivated by the need to mitigate the rise in fake news & online mis + disinformation. \n\nIt is in this light that #defyhatenow launched #AFFCameroon in partnership with @Adisi-Cameroun in July 2020; we received 50+ applications\, from which #ten Fellows were selected for the first cohort to run through July-August-September 2020. #Bonus ALL #seven #FactsMatter237 Fellows are equally participating in #AFFCameroon Fellowship.
