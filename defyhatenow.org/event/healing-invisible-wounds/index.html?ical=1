SUMMARY:Healing Invisible Wounds
DESCRIPTION:The ongoing crisis in the North West & South West Regions of #Cameroon has caused untold hardship on the local population; with women and girls constituting the vulnerable group and often direct victims. \nWe are proud to partner with Hope Advocates Africa an organization specialized in providing psycho-social support and counselling to survivors of violence\, in organizing a Trauma Healing Program for predominantly women and girls. \nThe session aims at offering participants the opportunity to heal from trauma or haunting experiences by telling their stories. Our #PeaceBuilding effort seeks to mitigate the effects of #hatespeech & #violence OFFLINE while promoting sustainable development through collective participation.
